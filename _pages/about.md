# About Me

I am **Cristian Jesús Vaca Rubio**, an AI for Wireless Communications researcher currently working at the **Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC)** in Barcelona.

My work lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing, and Wireless Communications**, with the goal of making future communication systems more intelligent, adaptive, and efficient. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can be embedded into the core of next-generation networks as a fundamental design principle.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Wireless Communications** from Aalborg University (Denmark) in 2023, where I was funded by a **Marie Curie Fellowship** as an Early Stage Researcher within the H2020 ITN WindMill project. During my Ph.D., I spent nine months as a **Visiting Researcher at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)** in Cambridge, MA, working on advanced problems in wireless sensing and learning-based communication systems.

Previously, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Telematics Engineering and Telecommunication Networks from the **University of Málaga** and worked as a research assistant in collaboration with **DEKRA GmbH**.

Across academia and applied research environments, my focus has consistently been on **bridging theory and practice**, developing methods that are mathematically grounded, data-driven, and relevant to real-world wireless systems. My work has been recognized with a **Top 3% Paper Award at IEEE ICASSP 2023**, and I am a co-author of a patent developed jointly with MERL collaborators.

This website serves as a curated portfolio of my research, publications, and ongoing projects, reflecting both my academic background and my interest in impactful applied AI for communications.

# Research Interests

My research revolves around **AI-native communication systems**, spanning both theoretical foundations and system-level applications:

*   **6G and Beyond Technologies**  
    Intelligent data-driven network architectures, joint communication and sensing, and AI-native air interfaces.

*   **AI for Satellite Communications**  
    Learning-enabled satellite networks, non-terrestrial networks, and scalable AI methods for space-ground integration.

*   **O-RAN and Open Radio Access Networks**  
    AI/ML for RAN intelligence, xApps and rApps, disaggregated architectures, and data-driven network control.

*   **Signal Processing for Communications and Sensing**  
    Model-based and learning-based approaches with a focus on interpretability and robustness.

*   **Massive MIMO and Millimeter Wave Systems**  
    Beamforming, tracking, and sensing under realistic hardware and propagation constraints.

*   **Applied Statistics and Data-Driven Networking**  
    Practical statistical modeling for performance analysis, optimization, and video streaming applications.
