This paper proposes a trusted probabilistic forecasting framework for terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks based on belief function theory. By explicitly modeling uncertainty and confidence in predictions, the proposed approach enables reliable decision-making for future network management and standardization-oriented use cases spanning integrated TN–NTN systems.
