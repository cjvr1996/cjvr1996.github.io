This work introduces **Fed-KAN**, a federated learning framework that integrates **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)** for traffic prediction in vehicular and mobile network environments. By leveraging the expressive and interpretable structure of KANs within a privacy-preserving federated setup, the proposed approach demonstrates improved predictive performance and robustness under heterogeneous data distributions, making it well suited for large-scale, distributed traffic forecasting scenarios.
