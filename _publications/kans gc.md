This paper introduces a novel application of **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)** to time series forecasting, leveraging their adaptive spline-based activation functions for enhanced predictive modeling. The results demonstrate improved accuracy over conventional MLPs with significantly fewer learnable parameters, validated through a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task and a detailed ablation study.
