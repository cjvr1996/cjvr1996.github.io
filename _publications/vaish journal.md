This paper proposes a cloud-native resource allocation framework for Open RAN, integrating multivariate probabilistic forecasting models within RAN Intelligent Controllers. Gaussian Process Vector Autoregression and Temporal Fusion Transformers are implemented as containerized rApps and evaluated against multivariate LSTM baselines, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy, uncertainty modeling, and computational efficiency in multi-tenant O-RAN environments.
