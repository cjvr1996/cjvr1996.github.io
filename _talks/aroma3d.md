The **AROMA3D project** was showcased at the **IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning for Communication and Networking (IEEE ICMLCN)**, held from **May 26 to May 29, 2025**, in **Barcelona, Spain**.

AROMA3D focuses on the design of **reliable beyond-5G (B5G) and 6G communications** in **three-dimensional networks**, integrating both **terrestrial and non-terrestrial network components**. The project is part of the Spanish **UNICO-5G** program and is coordinated by **SRCOM RU** at the **Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC)**. The consortium includes **Nearby Computing**, **Hispasat**, **INSTER – Grupo Oesía**, **INTEGRASYS Group**, **Fivecomm**, and **Celestia TTI**.

At the conference, the AROMA3D booth presented the **latest research results**, complemented by **demonstration videos** that provided a hands-on view of the project’s technological innovations. The exhibition offered an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas with the research community, engage with industry experts, and highlight the practical impact of the project.
