This presentation took place during the final training event of the **ITN WindMill** project, held at **ETH Zurich (ETHZ)**, where I had the opportunity to present my **PhD research work**.

The event brought together researchers from across the WindMill consortium, providing a competitive and enriching environment for scientific exchange, collaboration, and advanced training in areas such as **RF sensing**, **machine learning**, and **Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS)**.

The ITN WindMill project offered a highly valuable research and training framework over the three years of the doctoral program, fostering both technical development and interdisciplinary collaboration.
