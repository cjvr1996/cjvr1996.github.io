This talk corresponds to my **first formal interview** for the *ITN WindMill* Marie Skłodowska-Curie doctoral network, held at **Aalborg University, Department of Electronic Systems**.

During the interview, I presented my academic background, research interests, and motivation to pursue a PhD in **wireless communications**, with a particular focus on millimeter-wave systems and advanced networking concepts. The discussion also covered my previous experience, technical skills, and how my profile aligned with the objectives of the WindMill project.

This interview marked an important milestone in my research career, as it was related to my PhD position at Aalborg University under the ITN WindMill program.
