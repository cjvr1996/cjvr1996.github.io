Are you curious about the experience of being an **Early Stage Researcher (ESR)** under a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie** fellowship?

This post features the **one-year-later interview** with my fellow ESRs and myself from the **ITN WindMill project**, where we reflect on our research journey, training activities, and personal growth during the first year of the program.

The interview offers insights into life as an ESR, interdisciplinary research in **machine learning** and **wireless communications**, and the broader academic environment at **Aalborg University**.
