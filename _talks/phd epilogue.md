This epilogue interview reflects on my journey as a PhD candidate within the **ITN WindMill** Marie Skłodowska-Curie project, after completing the doctoral program.

Over the course of the PhD, I worked on **wireless sensing and communications**, combining signal processing and machine learning to address challenging problems related to **Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS)** and millimeter-wave systems. Beyond the technical contributions, the project provided a unique international and interdisciplinary research environment that strongly shaped my scientific mindset.

The WindMill network offered extensive training, exposure to industrial and academic partners, and valuable opportunities for collaboration, dissemination, and personal growth. These experiences not only strengthened my research skills, but also helped define my professional direction beyond the PhD.

This interview serves as a closing reflection on the challenges, lessons learned, and opportunities encountered throughout the doctoral journey, and on how this period has influenced my perspective on research, collaboration, and innovation.
