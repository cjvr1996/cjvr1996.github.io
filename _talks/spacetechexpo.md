I participated as a **panelist** at **Space Tech Expo Europe**, contributing to a panel discussion alongside more than **150 industry professionals** from across the space and satellite sectors.

The panel addressed key challenges and emerging trends in AI/ML for space technologies, fostering discussion between industry and research perspectives. The session provided a valuable opportunity for knowledge exchange, networking, and collaborative dialogue on the future of AI/ML in the space ecosystem.
