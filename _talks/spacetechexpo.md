This talk was delivered at the **Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)** within the framework of the **ELIXIRION-MC doctoral network**, together with **Luis Blanco** and **Engin Zeydan**.

The presentation covered key topics including **Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN)**, the use of **Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs)** for **Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN)**, and practical aspects of **data engineering** relevant to modern communication systems. The session aimed to provide doctoral students with both conceptual insights and applied perspectives on emerging technologies.

Beyond the technical content, the event represented a meaningful opportunity to contribute back to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie community. Having previously been a Marie Curie doctoral researcher, participating in this activity from the perspective of a speaker highlighted the value of continuity, mentorship, and knowledge exchange within doctoral networks.
